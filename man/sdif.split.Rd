\name{sdif.split}
\alias{sdif.split}
\title{to recode categorical variables. just does successive differences coding
(like contr.sdif), but is coded as continuous and split into multiple
factors, which is useful to remove random correlations from lmer models. This
is equivalent to deviation coding (-.5, .5) for binary contrasts. Input
should be coded as a factor(). Returns a data.frame to be cbind'ed to the
dataframe that x is in. The '.' in the column names should be interpreted as
a "minus".}
