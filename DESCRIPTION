Title: Slim down (g)lmer models by removing random correlations until
    convergence.
Type: Package
Author: Klinton Bicknell <kbicknell@northwestern.edu>
Description: Often (g)lmer models (from the lme4 package) with a large number of
    random correlations to estimate will fail to converge. lmer.slimr provides
    functions that iteratively simplify the random correlation matrix until
    convergence. In order to make this process faster, it can evaluate this
    sequence of models in parallel.
